A 3D poser and animation rigging application built on WebGL. The Goal of this application is to generate inputs for dosimetry simulation . The user can set up the simulation parameters like the position of the dummy test and the position of C-arm and its 2 angles, then generate a gate script that will be used for monte-carlo simulation.

[How Does It Work] :
- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have Node.js installed in you system
- CD to the project and run : 
	*- npm i --save-dev electron    ("NOTE : since git hub does not allow you to upload large file and electron contain some large files")
	*- npm start
